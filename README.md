## Features

- Movie and TV show data: The project uses the TMDB API and YouTube Search API to fetch and display movie and TV show data. Users can browse through a collection     of popular movies and TV shows, search for specific titles, and view trailers.

- Responsive design: The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the user interface is optimized for all screen sizes and devices. This includes          desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
 
- Front-end development: The project showcases skills in front-end development, specifically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface,            implement interactivity, and fetch data from APIs.
  
- Project management: The project was developed using a version control system (Git) and follows best practices for code organization and documentation.

This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and understanding of building a real-world website layout.
